      "en": " Automated Clearing House (ACH) transaction volume is growing very rapidly. Just in the third quarter of 2009, there were 1.6 BILLION ACH web transactions. This is a 20% increase from the previous year. Skyline realized the enormous need for simple, fast, and cheap solutions for businesses using ACH. This is how CheckAlt was born. CheckAlt is among the countryâ??s premier providers of automated and electronic check transaction processing, meeting the exacting needs of businesses that provide services and products to other businesses. CheckAltâ??s primary focus is on improving its clientsâ?? top and bottom lines. CheckAltâ??s unique partnership strategy, its in-depth industry knowledge, and innovative processing solutions, assists its clients in bringing additional revenue through a value added network of affiliated CheckAlt clients. In addition, CheckAlt enables its clients to reduce associated costs in transaction processing over the internet. One of the biggest operating expenses for on-line merchants is their associated credit card processing and handling fees. We facilitate the migration of expensive card-not-present (â??CNPâ??) bankcard discount fees, wire charges by the Federal Reserve Banks, and credit card fees to cost effective automated clearing house (â??ACHâ??) charges. Furthermore, CheckAlt uses various forms of check verification and risk management procedures to reduce the exposure of check losses designed specifically for each client, utilizing each clientâ??s unique risk â??foot-print.â?? In turn, our clients maximize profits and eliminate the costs associated with Check guarantee. CheckAlt does not profit by its clientsâ?? losses. In the Check guarantee model, the check guarantee company provider doesnâ??t lose, but the merchant often does. In fact, many check guarantee providers quip that they have saved merchants money by declining checks at point of purchase; while all that the guarantee company is really doing is minimizing its own risk exposure at the expense of the merchant. CheckAltâ??s risk management procedures minimize our clients risk exposure, without impeding their profitability. CheckAlt Payment Solutions is among the countryâ??s premier payment processing companies providing Check21 services allowing businesses nationwide to utilize its eCheck and patented Remote Desktop Capture (RDC) systems to improve their top and bottom lines. The CheckAlt eCheck is the â??email a checkâ?? solution that allows businesses from merchants and property managers to universities and non-profits to maximize cash flow and accounting accuracy. CheckAltâ??s unique RDC empowers businesses such as credit unions and community banks by enabling them to locally deposit scanned checks virtually while reducing associated internet transaction processing costs. Streamlined clients experience the benefits of receiving funds in less than 12 hours without having to change banks or accounting systems. Swift, simple, and safe: CheckAlt Payment Solutions is the smartest way to do business. "

      "en": " Transact24 Limited is incorporated with its Head Office in Hong Kong with operations, technical and support centers in Hong Kong, Zuhai (China), South Africa and Singapore. Regional registered satellite offices are located in Australia, Austria, the UK ,Indonesia, Macau and the USA. Established in 2006, the company was formed by a Swedish Venture Capital entity and staff with Hong Kong as its chosen domicile to capture the emerging Chinese online market. Staff compliment is primarily South African and Chinese and the focus of the business is to become the Internet Payment Service Provider (iPSP) of choice for the emerging markets in Asia and the Southern hemisphere. Strategic alliances with unique iPSP operators soon culminated in an abundance of services that are made available to merchants worldwide via a single API integration. These services include inter alia Ukash, Entropay, Envoy and China Union Pay, the latter specifically for the Chinese market. Transact24 Limited soon recognized the Remittance Market as one of the key growth areas in South East Asia and Africa. Numerous strategic alliances were formed with the likes of Envoy and US ACH service providers to tap into the lucrative Chinese and Philippine Remittance Markets. A further investment in infrastructure and people brought about T24 Global Issuance (T24GI) in 2009. The need for a bespoke prepaid Credit Card in the defined emerging markets landed T24GI with two large strategic card issuing projects in South Africa and South East Asia. Transact24 Limited incorporated a Call Center operation to support its Merchants and the Card Projects. This 24x7x365 support center also acts as an independent support center for international iPSPâ??s and their merchants. Transact24 Limited has launched Ukash â?? www.ukashchina.com in a unique sole joint venture in China during November 2009. The project took 18 months from conception to final launch and is specifically aimed at the Remittance Market to offer merchants alternative payment options in China. The Future Transact24 Limited is similarly expanding its footprint in Southern Africa with identified projects in the Card Issuing space and with new acquiring opportunities outside of the well-known South African banking arena. Similar projects have been identified in South America and these opportunities will be commissioned in 2011. Transact24 Limited is in process of launching its own branded prepaid Credit Card for markets in South East Asia, Africa and South America. Launch dates and details will be available in 1st Quarter 2011. "

This was the birth of Cardsave, a unique buying group dedicated to providing competitive business services to the small business sector.  Over the last 15 years we have supported our merchants through a range of payment industry developments.From the early migration of “zip-zap” payments to electronic transactions, the deployment of secure Chip & PIN payment devices to the more recent dramatic expansion in the use of cards to take online payments we have helped merchants every step of the way.  "

Our long-standing experience with online payments makes us a valuable business partner to both small and independent webshop owners and large international companies. "

      "en": " Kiwipay is bundled credit card merchant facility and gateway. Our goal is to make it easier and less expensive for New Zealand businesses to accept credit cards online.  Our goal is to create an online payment platform that makes it easier and cheaper for any New Zealand organisation to process credit card payments online.  Kiwipay was originally created in 2004 as Lucid Pay, a side project of Lucid Design. It was setup for a handful of bed & breakfast clients who need to take credit card payments from guests overseas. At that time, PayPal™ wasn’t available in New Zealand and the only option was to open a merchant account with a bank. This was simply not cost-effective for small businesses with infrequent, small transactions. Lucid Pay had no monthly fees and a (relatively at the time) low commission rate. It operated in closed beta with a small number of clients until 2011 when the entire platform was rebuilt from the ground and became Kiwipay. "

As a result, the world around us is changing rapidly We are barely able to imagine a world without mobile phones or the internet anymore, for example. This changing world is also creating new demands and it requires (technological) solutions that are in keeping with these. An example of this is the need for innovative payment solutions, which is partly due to the rise of the internet. A dependable partner In 2000, DialXS began to develop innovative payment solutions and since then, it has been a dependable partner for payment systems that allow consumers of services and products (whether or not available online) to make payments simply and safely. DialXS stands for safe solutions, customer focus, flexibility, reliable technology and perfection. DialXS provides optimal service; a team of passionate, expert and enthusiastic employees are always ready to advise and assist you. Customised solutions DialXS is an open-minded company. Our basic principle is: anything is possible. We will work with you to find the specific applications that best suit your needs. In other words, customised solutions. Because for us, working with you to devise such solutions encompasses a great deal more than just the technology for which we are responsible. All the necessary knowledge is available to us in house and we are always on the lookout for pioneering work, for new solutions. What this means is that we always like to think outside-the-box. User-friendliness For us, the starting point when developing technology is always the user, and that resulted in our accessible payment systems. All it takes to make a payment is a single telephone call, a single text message, or just a few clicks of the mouse. It could not be any easier. But the payment systems are also user-friendly for the webmaster. Quality and continuity High-quality technology is used for payment solutions provided by DialXS, and this technology guarantees quality, speed and continuity. The high quality of the software used is the result of many years of development and improvement.   "

VietUnion is oriented towards establishing a foundation of secure and convenient transactions for developing Vietnamese e-commerce. Accordingly, Payoo online payment system that VietUnion is developing is one of the efforts to eradicate the barriers in present-day Vietnamese e-commerce.     In 2007, Vietnamese e-commerce owned promising development landmarks keeping with the development trend of the world e-commerce. However, according to the data released by the Ministry of Trade in late 2006, among 20-25% of businesses with websites, only 27.4% of the websites accept orders and the modest amount of 3.2% accept online payment. The habit of using cash in Vietnam and the limitations of credit cards have partially created invisible barriers against the development of e-commerce.    Catching up the impetuous development trend of Vietnamese e-commerce in the years to come as well as the lack of an effective payment mode, VietUnion Online Services Corporation coordinates with various banks and businesses to develop the Payoo e-wallet with efforts in establishing verified users' communities, minimizing the risks and securing safe transactions through secure forms of Payment and delivery.

Whether you are an established online business or a brand new startup, accepting DaoPay is almost certainly the easiest way for you to instantly grow your business. Although you might already accept all the major credit cards and even PayPal, chances are you are missing out on a significant number of people who do not feel comfortable sharing their credit card number over the internet because they are concerned about their privacy. Or they do not have a credit card, which is still very common in many countries and with certain target groups, p.ex. young consumers playing online games. Charging your phone bill. With DaoPay, customers can charge the purchase of your product to their phone bill. All they need is a phone - mobile or landline. They just dial a service number or send a text\/SMS and without ever giving away any personal or financial information. When using 'pay by call' they hold the line until the the transaction is complete. Alternatively they send an SMS or insert their mobile number on the screen and use the most convenient payment method: direct billing. Reach additional audiences. Customers enjoy DaoPay because it is so convenient and, at the same time, more secure than any other payment method. No credit cards, no bank accounts or any other contracts - just dial a number or send a text\/SMS and you are all set. Adding DaoPay as a complementary payment option means you reach more people and receive more payments than with any other single payment method alone. This gives you access to new markets and additional clients.
